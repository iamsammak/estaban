background: url();
handling a file path doesn't work

Solution:

SOLUTION ONE:
Add ?url=false to your css-loader, that will disable url handling :

e.g: ['css-loader?url=false', 'sass-loader'] ...

SOLUTION TWO:
You can also try using
~ before you path to the image

Notably: background-url: (~assets/image/myimage) should resolve the path
